## Q1: Sum Divisible by K

### Problem Statement
Given an array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the sum of all elements where their frequency is divisible by `k`.

### Examples
```
Input: nums = [1,2,2,2,3,3,3,3], k = 2
Output: 18
Explanation: 
- 1 appears 1 time (1 % 2 != 0) → not included
- 2 appears 3 times (3 % 2 != 0) → not included
- 3 appears 4 times (4 % 2 == 0) → included: 3 * 4 = 12

Wait, let me recalculate based on the code:
For each unique value, if frequency % value == 0, add value * frequency
```

### Solution Approach
**Algorithm**: Hash Map Frequency Count
- Use a hash map to count frequency of each number
- For each unique number, check if its frequency is divisible by the number itself
- If yes, add `number × frequency` to the sum

**Time Complexity**: O(n) - Single pass through array + iterate unique values
**Space Complexity**: O(n) - Hash map storage

### Key Insights
- The condition `frequency % value == 0` is checking if the frequency is divisible by the value itself, not by k
- This is a straightforward counting problem with a twist

## Q2: Longest Balanced String

### Problem Statement
Find the longest substring where all distinct characters appear with the same frequency.

### Examples
```
Input: s = "aabbc"
Output: 4
Explanation: "abbc" has 'a' appearing 1 time, 'b' appearing 2 times, 'c' appearing 1 time
Actually, "aabb" has 'a' appearing 2 times, 'b' appearing 2 times → balanced!
```

### Solution Approach
**Algorithm**: Brute Force with Frequency Check
1. Try all possible substrings using two nested loops
2. For each substring, maintain a frequency map
3. Check if all characters have the same frequency
4. Track the maximum length found

**Time Complexity**: O(n²) for generating substrings, O(alphabet_size) for checking balance → O(n²)
**Space Complexity**: O(alphabet_size) for frequency map

### Key Insights
- A balanced string means ALL distinct characters must appear the same number of times
- The brute force approach works because:
  - We need to check all substrings anyway
  - Alphabet size is typically small (26 for lowercase English)
- For this problem, the O(n²) complexity is acceptable given typical constraints

## Q3: Longest Balanced Substring (Only 'a', 'b', 'c')

### Problem Statement
Find the longest substring where all distinct characters (from 'a', 'b', 'c' only) appear with the same frequency.

### Examples
```
Input: s = "abbac"
Output: 4
Explanation: "abba" has 'a' appearing 2 times, 'b' appearing 2 times → length 4

Input: s = "accc"
Output: 3
Explanation: "ccc" has only 'c' appearing 3 times → balanced, length 3
```

### Solution Approach
**Algorithm**: State-Based Hash Map with Bitmask Enumeration

This is an advanced optimization over Q2, leveraging the constraint of only 3 possible characters.

**Key Innovation**: Instead of checking all substrings, we use a "state difference pattern" approach:
1. **Enumerate all character subsets**: Try all 7 possible subsets {a}, {b}, {c}, {ab}, {ac}, {bc}, {abc}
2. **State representation**: For each subset, track the difference between character counts
   - State = (count[0] - count[1], count[1] - count[2])
   - When state returns to a previous state, characters have balanced counts
3. **Handle invalid characters**: When encountering a character not in the current subset, reset tracking

**State Pattern Insight**:
- If we see state (0, 0) at positions i and j, then from i+1 to j, all characters have equal counts
- Example: For "aabbc" tracking {a,b,c}:
  - After "aa": counts=[2,0,0], state=(2,0)
  - After "aabb": counts=[2,2,0], state=(0,2)
  - After "aabbc": counts=[2,2,1], state=(0,1)

**Time Complexity**: O(7n) = O(n) - Linear scan for each of 7 character subsets
**Space Complexity**: O(n) - State hash map in worst case

### Why This Works
The state-based approach is much faster than O(n²) because:
1. We don't generate all substrings
2. State repetition automatically finds balanced segments
3. Only 3 characters means limited state space

### Key Optimizations Applied
1. **Removed verification function**: Trust the state-based detection
2. **Reset on invalid characters**: Prevents spanning across invalid segments
3. **Track valid start position**: Ensures correctness after resets
4. **Single pass per subset**: No nested loops needed

## Q4: Sum of Ancestor Pairs (Perfect Squares)

### Problem Statement
Given a tree rooted at node 0, for each non-root node i, count how many ancestors have the property that `nums[i] × nums[ancestor]` is a perfect square. Return the sum of all counts.

### Examples
```
Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2]], nums = [2,8,2]
Output: 3
Explanation:
- Node 1: ancestor 0 → 8 × 2 = 16 = 4² ✓ (count = 1)
- Node 2: ancestors [1,0]
  - 2 × 8 = 16 = 4² ✓
  - 2 × 2 = 4 = 2² ✓
  - (count = 2)
- Total: 1 + 2 = 3
```

### Solution Approach
**Algorithm**: DFS with Square-Free Number Theory

**Core Mathematical Insight**: 
Two numbers multiply to a perfect square **if and only if** they have the same "square-free" part.

**What is Square-Free Part?**
- A number's square-free part is the product of all its prime factors with odd exponents
- Examples:
  - 8 = 2³ → square-free = 2 (exponent 3 is odd)
  - 4 = 2² → square-free = 1 (exponent 2 is even, removed)
  - 18 = 2¹ × 3² → square-free = 2 (only 2 has odd exponent)
  - 12 = 2² × 3¹ → square-free = 3

**Why This Works?**
```
If a = p1^e1 × p2^e2 × ... and b = p1^f1 × p2^f2 × ...
Then a × b is a perfect square ⟺ all (ei + fi) are even

This happens ⟺ ei and fi have same parity for all primes
⟺ square-free(a) == square-free(b)
```

**Algorithm Steps**:
1. **Precompute square-free values** for all nums[i]
2. **Build tree** as adjacency list
3. **DFS traversal** with ancestor tracking:
   - Maintain a map of square-free values along path from root
   - For each node, count ancestors with matching square-free value
   - Use backtracking to properly manage ancestor map

**Time Complexity**: 
- Square-free computation: O(n × √max(nums))
- DFS: O(n)
- **Total**: O(n × √max(nums))

**Space Complexity**: O(n) for tree structure and ancestor tracking

### Implementation Details

**Square-Free Computation Optimization**:
```go
func getSquareFree(num int) int {
    result := 1
    // Handle 2 separately
    count := 0
    for num % 2 == 0 {
        count++
        num /= 2
    }
    if count % 2 == 1 {
        result *= 2
    }
    
    // Only check odd factors
    for i := 3; i*i <= num; i += 2 {
        count := 0
        for num % i == 0 {
            count++
            num /= i
        }
        if count % 2 == 1 {
            result *= i
        }
    }
    
    // Remaining factor is prime
    if num > 1 {
        result *= num
    }
    return result
}
```

**DFS with Backtracking**:
```go
func dfs(node, parent int, ancestors map[int]int) {
    // Count matching ancestors
    if node != 0 {
        totalSum += ancestors[squareFree[node]]
    }
    
    // Add self to path
    ancestors[squareFree[node]]++
    
    // Visit children
    for _, child := range graph[node] {
        if child != parent {
            dfs(child, node, ancestors)
        }
    }
    
    // Backtrack (remove self from path)
    ancestors[squareFree[node]]--
}
```

### Key Insights
1. **Number theory is crucial**: Recognizing the square-free property transforms an apparent O(n²) problem into O(n × √max(nums))
2. **DFS with backtracking**: Essential for efficiently tracking ancestors without copying maps
3. **Hash map vs array**: Using a map is better than a 10⁵-size array since only a subset of square-free values appear
4. **Optimization matters**: Handling factor 2 separately cuts iterations in half

### Why This Is Optimal
- Cannot avoid computing square-free parts: O(√num) is optimal for prime factorization
- Cannot avoid visiting each node: O(n) DFS is necessary
- Hash map operations are O(1) average case
- No redundant work is performed
